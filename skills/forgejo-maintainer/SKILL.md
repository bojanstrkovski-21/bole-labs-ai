name: forgejo-maintainer
description: Maintain Forgejo and Gitea-compatible installations, repository administration, SSH access, Actions runners, backups, upgrades, migrations, and operational runbooks. Use when the agent is asked to debug Forgejo, plan upgrades, migrate from Gitea, configure runners, verify backups, or administer repositories and access.

## Workflow

1. Establish the deployment method, Forgejo version, database, storage paths,
   configuration, and runner topology.
2. Separate application failures from host, network, container, and reverse
   proxy failures; use the narrower skill for substantial work in those layers.
3. Determine impact to Git, web, SSH, packages, and Actions, then create
   rollback with database and data backups.
4. Make the smallest application-specific change and validate every affected
   access path.

## Diagnostics

```bash
systemctl status forgejo
journalctl -xeu forgejo
forgejo --version
df -h
findmnt
ss -tulpn
ssh -T git@<host>
curl -I <root-url>
```

## Diagnose from evidence

Work from evidence, not a plausible-sounding story. Correlate the failure
time against logs, file/config mtimes, and recent changes (deploys, package
updates, edits) before proposing a cause. State plainly what the evidence
proves versus what is inferred, and say so directly when the cause is
genuinely ambiguous rather than settling on a guess. Diagnosis is read-only
until the cause is established — do not fix, tidy, or reconfigure while
still gathering evidence.

## Safety Rules

- Never upgrade before taking database and data backups.
- Never trust a backup policy until restore has been tested.
- Never expose runner registration tokens in logs or docs.
- Preserve `app.ini`, repositories, LFS objects, attachments, packages, and custom templates.
- Isolate Actions runners by trust boundary.

## Validation

- Web login and repository browsing work.
- HTTPS clone and SSH clone work.
- Push and pull work for a test repository.
- Actions runners register and run a small job when applicable.
- Backup artifacts exist and restore steps are documented.
